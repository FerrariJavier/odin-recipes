        <p>Everyone who knows my grandma loves her <em>Milanesa</em> empanizada (breaded Milanese). I learned how to cook thanks to her, and when I was 7 years old I learned how to cook this Milanesa de res recipe. I consider this recipe a basic on Mexican cuisine. You're gonna love it! You can serve this with French fries, rice, refried beans, or a salad (we use lettuce, tomato, avocado, and cucumber slices with a twist of lemon). Corn or flour tortillas go great with all this.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>40 saltine crackers</li>
                <li>4 thin slices boneless round steak</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Directions:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack eggs in a medium bowl and beat slightly with a fork or whisk. Set aside. Place smashed crackers on a plate big enough for the steak.</li>
                <li>Season steak with salt and pepper and soak in the beaten egg. Transfer to the smashed crackers and cover both sides with the crackers using a spoon; you can press a little bit with the spoon so that the crackers stick better.</li>
                <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom half of the steaks. Cook 2 steaks in the hot oil until crackers have turned light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and continue to cook until golden and meat is no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining steaks.</li>
            </ol>
