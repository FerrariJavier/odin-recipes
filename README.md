This has been a nice experience on basic self-taught programming. Before starting the course I had the idea that coding was like magic, something not for everyone and that if you haven't started when you were young then it was too late. Wrong.
It's never too late, but it is later every day that passes, so you better get to it, quick, and don't look back.
So far I learned basics of: Git, HTML, using the Terminal and mindset stuff.
Currently I'm doing a basic functional web page on this project, which will allow me to learn how to do one from start to finish whenever I need to in the future.
